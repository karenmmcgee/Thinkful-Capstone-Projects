# Thinkful-Capstone-Projects

Presentations of completed Thinkful capstone projects during my time with Thinkful Data science program.

•	Supervised Capstone: Build a model to improve the Zillow Zestimate residual error (also known as the log-error) (i.e. “Zestimates” are estimated home values based).

•	Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest regression and Decision Tree regression

• Unsupervised Capston: Build an unsupervised model that will classify authors based on the style of writing using natural language processing. 

• Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, KMeans, Meanshift, Spectural Clustering, Affinity proporgation, KNN classification, SVM classification, Random Forest classification, Logistic classification and Gradient Boosting classification.
