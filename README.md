# Thinkful-Capstone-Projects

Presentations of completed Thinkful capstone projects during my time with Thinkful Data science program.

•	Supervised Capstone: Build a model to improve the Zillow Zestimate residual error (also known as the log-error) (i.e. “Zestimates” are estimated home values based).

•	Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest regression and Decision Tree regression

• Unsupervised Capstone: Build an unsupervised model that will classify authors based on the style of writing using natural language processing. 

• Unsupervised Capstone: Build an unsupervised model that will analyze song lyrics and determine the sentiment analysis of song (whether it is positive or negative). In addition, when given the name of song, the model will provide a list of ten recommended songs that match the mood of the given song.

• Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, KMeans, Mean shift, Spectral Clustering, Affinity propagation, KNN classification, SVM classification, Random Forest classification, Logistic classification and Gradient Boosting classification.
